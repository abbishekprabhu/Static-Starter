# Static-Starter
This is a Static Starter Page using basic stacks which you can clone or fork and use.

This is a quick static starter page using HTML CSS JS which you can use to create a new site or landing page or whatever you need. This is responsive, so you also don't need worry about the NAVBAR. Everything is ALL SET and If you have any javascript code that makes the page more secure. Feel free to do that. I am Open to it.

It is Open Source Project done by me and it is beginner friendly
